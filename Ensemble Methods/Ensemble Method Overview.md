Ensemble methods is a machine learning algorithm that obtains better predictive performance by combining multiple algorithms together.

There are two types of ensemble methods, parallel and sequential.  Below are some examples.

__Parallel__:  An ensemble method that averages the outputs of multiple algorithms
- Majority Voting
- Bagging
- Stacking
- Random Forests

__Sequential__:  An ensemble method that sequentially reweights the training samples to force the algorithm to focus on examples that have higher error rates.
- Boosting
